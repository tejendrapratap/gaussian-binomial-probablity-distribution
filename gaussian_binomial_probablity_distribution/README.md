# gaussian-binomial-probablity-distribution package

Ths package is an implementation of the Gaussian Probablity density function and the Binomial Probablity density function

# Files

This package currently contains three files 
1.Generaldistribution.py - This contain the parent class Distribution that calculates mean, standard deviations and can read from a file

2.Gaussiandistribution.py - This contains a child class Gaussian of Distribution that calculates mean, standard deviations and plot histogram

3.Binomialdistribution.py - This contains a child class Binomial of Distribution that calculates mean, standard deviations and plot bar charts

# Installation

pip install gaussian-binomial-probablity-distribution
